## My process

### Built with

- BEM methodology
- Sass/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned the basics of Sass/SCSS and I especially liked the ability to split the code into modules.

```scss
@use 'variables';
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on using Sass/SCSS more frequently.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me to learn what Sass/SCSS is. I really liked Sass because of its modular approach and the ability to do math in CSS.
